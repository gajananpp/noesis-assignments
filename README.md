# noesis-assignments
#### Assignments consist of three single page applications which can be run on xampp or wamp server by simply cloning this repo in htdocs folder of server and starting apache server from panel.
##### Each application's directory structure is factored on basis of feature of component.


## See apps running on following links:
- [Check Prime Number](http://checkprime.herokuapp.com)
- [Check Palindrome String](http://checkpalindrome.herokuapp.com)
- [Generate Fibonacci Sequence](http://generatefib.herokuapp.com)

### Note: Since apps are deployed on heroku free dyno instances, apps sleeps after 30min of no incoming web-traffic and may require few more seconds to load.
